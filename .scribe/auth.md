# Authenticating requests

To authenticate requests, include an **`Authorization`** header with the value **`"Bearer {YOUR_AUTH_TOKEN}"`**.

All authenticated endpoints are marked with a `requires authentication` badge in the documentation below.

Authenticate by sending a Bearer token in the Authorization header. You can obtain a token by calling the login endpoint.
